> Hello,
>
> I’m sorry to hear you are having some issues with your UPPAbaby VISTA stroller. In our warranty it states that we do expect that our strollers have routine maintenance. I am happy to assist with getting your stroller back in tip top shape. I believe that the following Tune Up Tips can quickly resolve the issue that you are having.

> I have included a link to a PDF document with washing instructions and general care tips for your VISTA.

> I would suggest cleaning out both the back brake housing and middle joint. I would also fold your VISTA and with compressed air or WD-40 spray out the black plastic middle joint that is spring loaded and tap on the spring loaded joint to clean any dirt or debris out of the middle joint.

> Are your brakes on your VISTA acting a little sticky? Some routine maintenance can get your stroller stopping on a dime in no time. To service the brake, remove the back wheels by pushing in the rear hubcaps and sliding off the wheels. Make sure the back wheel housing is clean of any dirt, sand or debris. The brake pin can get ‘gunked’ up especially if you spend time near the beach or through heavy use. To clean the brake pins on the back wheel housing, you can use something as simple as compressed air (like when you go to the service station to fill up your car tires with air) or even the same can of compressed air that you use to clean your computer keyboard. For tougher grime use a spray lubricant like wd-40. After cleaning, wipe the area down with a damp cloth then hit the brake a few times with the wheels off. Reattach your wheels and you will be good to go. I have also included brake photos for your reference.

> • Replace all 4 wheels back onto the frame
> • Fold the VISTA and spray out the black plastic middle joint with WD-40 and tap on spring loaded middle joint to make sure it is free of dirt and debris. Here is a quick video we made showing this process: https://youtu.be/LIAifnfwLfI

> Hi, my 2010 vista has become very difficult to fold. It takes like 30+ tries of pushing both buttons to get it to collapse. Is there anything that can help fix this?
